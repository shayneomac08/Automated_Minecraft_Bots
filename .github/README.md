# Automated Minecraft Bots — Your Real Grok Squad 🧠🪓

**Spawn 9+ autonomous buddies that act like REAL Minecraft players** — they chop trees with crafted axes, build shelters at night, open doors for you, pick up items, chat with each other, share knowledge, and hang out like a living squad.

### ✨ Core Features
- `/amb spawnmulti 9 grok` — spawns 9 random-named, random-gender bots using Grok (or gemini/openai) in one command
- Brain **always ON** automatically on spawn
- Zero dirt kicking (silent real-player movement)
- Auto-craft & use wooden axes
- Night-time shelter building (5x5 oak planks + working door)
- Group chat & map sharing
- Perfect inventory sync (`/amb gui <name>`)
- Works with Grok, Gemini, OpenAI — each LLM group has its own personality

### Commands
- `/amb spawnmulti <count> <llm> [group]` ← your new favorite
- `/amb gui <name>` — open their real 36-slot backpack
- `/amb brain <name> on/off`
- `/amb spawn 1 grok` — old single spawn still works

### How to Play With Your Buddies
1. Throw oak logs + apples at them
2. `/time set night` — watch them drop everything and build bases
3. They open doors for you, craft axes, say “Just crafted myself a wooden axe!” and “Come inside my shelter!”
4. Toss them items → they keep them forever

**Made with love for the ultimate Minecraft squad experience.**
